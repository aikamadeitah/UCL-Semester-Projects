# Solar Panel Project

This project is working towards a solution for solar panels. 
They normally don't follow the sun, instead sitting in a single direction and soaking up solar radiation. 
We want to optimize that process so we're getting 100% of the sun 100% of the time. 
To that end we're working on technology to figure out where the sun is with a shadowbox and calculating where we will get the most 
light with and helps safeguard the solar panel controls, not allowing it to damage itself.
