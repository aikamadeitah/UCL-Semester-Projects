# HALL SENSORS

Using semiconductors (such as silicon), Hall effect sensors work by measuring the changing voltage when the device is placed in a magnetic field. In other words, once a Hall effect sensor detects that it is now in a magnetic field, it is able to sense the position of objects.

When in the presence of an external magnetic field it is able to sense whether the object is close or far, and act accordingly.
	
There are 2 types, Analog and Digital. Analog uses a continuos voltage output that increases in a strong magnetic field and decreases in a weak magnetic field. Digital outputs have a Schmitt Trigger which is a bistable circuit that steadily increases and decreases the output when voltage rises and falls.
	
Furthermore, there are  2 type of Digital Hall Sensor, which are Bipolar and Unipolar. The difference is the type of magnetic field they need. Bipolar needs a positive magnetic field to operate them and a negative magnetic field to release them. Unipolar just needs a magnetic negative to both operate and release them.

The magnets in Hall Sensors work in 4 different ways; Head On, Sideways, Push-Pull and Push-Push. The two most common are Head On and Sideways. Head on detection is where the magnet is perpendicular to the Hall Effect Sensor, and the output voltage is greater the closer the magnet is to the Hall Sensor. Sideways Detection is when the magnet moves across the face of the Hall Sensor in a sideways motion (like seeing how fast a motor is rotating.
	
Hall Monitors can be used for current measurement if you reverse the process of how they work

# TEMPERATURE SENSORS

	1. Thermocouples
There are 8 different types of Thermocouples (B, E, J, K, N, R, S, T). They are a sensor used to measure temperature. They consist of 2 wire legs made from different metals, welded together at one end to create a junction. The junction is where the temperature is measured, and this works because when the junction experiences a change in temperature voltage is created which then can be interpreted.

Thermocouples of type E, J, K, and T are made of base metals and the most common. R, S, and B are made of Noble metals which are used for high temperature applications. Thermocouples are typically selected as a component because of their low cost, high temperature limits, wide temperature range and durable nature.

Type K - Nickel-Chromium (Inexpensive, Accurate, Reliable, Wide Temp Range) Wire is graded -270 to 1260 c and the wires are rated 0 to 200c with an accuracy of +/- .75%

Type J - Iron (Equivelant to Type K in expense and reliability) Wire is graded -210 to 1400 c and the wires are rated 0 to 200c with an accuracy of +/- .75%

Type T - Copper (Stable at low temperatures and often picked for extremely cold temps) Wire is graded -270 to 370c and the wires are rated 0 to 200c with an accuracy of +/- .75%

Type E - Nickel-Chromium (Stronger signal, higher accuracy than Type K or J at moderate temp ranges) Wire is graded -270 to 870 c and the wires are rated 0 to 200c with an accuracy of +/- .5%

Type N - Nicrosil (Same accuracy and temp limits as Type K, but more expensive) Wire is graded -270 to 392 c and the wires are rated 0 to 200c with an accuracy of +/- .75%

Type S + R - Platinum Rhodium 10/13%(Used in very high temp accplications, but sometimes used elsewhere because high accuracy and stability) Wire is graded -50 to 1480 c and the wires are rated 0 to 200c with an accuracy of +/- .25%

Type B - Platinum Rhodium 30%(Used in extremely high temp applications, has the highest upper temp of everything listed above) Wire is graded 0 to 1700 c and the wires are rated 0 to 100c with an accuracy of +/- .25%

	2. Resistance Temperature Detectors(RTD)
Resistance Temperature Detectors are sometimes referred to as resistance thermometers. It is defined as 'a temperature measuring device composed of a resistance thermometer element, internal connecting wires, a protective shell with/without a means of mounting a connection hear or connecting wires or both.'

RTD's work on the principle that as metal rises in temperature its resistance to the flow of electricity increases. Similarly, as the temperature of the RTD resistance element increases the electrical resistance (rated in Ohms) increases. RTD elements are commonly specified according to their resistance in ohms at 0'c

Platinum is the most commonly used metal for RTD because of its chemical inertness, nearly linear temperature versus resistance relationship, its temperature coefficient of resistance and its stability. (Other options include nickel, copper and Balco.)

The more wires an RTD has, the more accurate it is. 

	3. Thermistor
Is a semiconductor which means they have greater resistance than conducting materials but lower resistance than insulating materials. A Thermistor's temperature and resistance are highly dependant on what its made out of. 

Thermistors are thermally sensitive resistors, an accurate and cost effective sensor for measuring the temperature. They come in 2 types, NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) and PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient). NTC is what is commonly used to measure temperature.

Thermistors are accurate to approximately +/-2 c within their specified temp range. They are longer lasting, inexpensive and durable. They are often selected when ruggedness, reliability and stability are important, such as in environments with extreme conditions or where electronic noise is present. They come with epoxy or glass coating depending on the expected temperature of the environment that they will be installed in

They come in a couple of common configurations depending on how they are expected to function. HSTH Thermistors are completely sealed within plastic polymer to protect the sensing elements from moisture and corrosion. They can be used to measure the temp of a wide selection of liquids Bolt/Washer Mounted Sensors can be installed into standard sized threaded holes. Their small thermal mass enables them to respond to temperature changes rapidly. Surface Mounted Thermistors come with adhesive exteriors that can easily be stuck in place on flat or curved surfaces.

Thermistors are highly accurate (ranging from ± 0.05°C to ± 1.5°C), but only over a limited temperature range that is within about 50°C of a base temperature. The working temperature range for most thermistors is between 0°C and 100°C. Class A thermistors offer the greatest accuracy, while Class B thermistors can be used in scenarios where there’s less need for exact measurement. Once the manufacturing process is complete, thermistors are chemically stable and their accuracy does not change significantly with age. 

# HUMIDITY SENSORS

Another name for a Humidity Sensor is a Hygrometer and it can be classified based on the type of humidity that it is used for measuring (like Absolute Humidity or Relative Humidity sensors). They can also be classified based on the parameters used for measuring humidity (i.e. capacitive, electrical conductivity, electrical resistivity or Thermal conductivity). There are different styles based on how the information is acquired(more research required)(Optical, Oscillating, and Gravimetric)

Capacitive Humidity Sensors are used where factors like cost, rigidity and size are a concern. In Capacitive Relative Humidity Sensors, electrical permittivity of dielectric material changes with humidity. They are good when the output voltage is linear, they provide stable results over a long period of time and they can detect a wide range of RH. They can't be far away from the signaling circuit though. Common uses are in fax machines and automobiles.

Resistive Humidity Sensors measure resistance/electrical conductivity. The advantages of these are their low cost, small size, available distance between the sensor and signal circuit and a high capacity for interchangability. The disadvantages are that these particular models are sensitive to contaminants like chemical vapor and the readings may shift if they come in contact with water soluble products.

Thermal Conductivity Humidity Sensors (also known as Absolute Humidity Sensors which measure ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY. measure the thermal conductivity of dry or wet air. The difference is related to the absolute humidity. The advantages of Thermal Conductivity Humidity Sensors are that they work well in High temperatures and highly corrosive environments, they are durable and they have a higher resolution comparitively, but exposure to any gas with thermal properties (other than Nitrogen) will probably affect reading measurements.

Factors to be taken into consideration when selecting a Humidity Sensor include Accuracy, Calibration, Size, Cost, Output Repeatability, Circuit Complexity, Resistance to contamination and Reliability.


# AIRFLOW SENSORS

Mass Airflow Sensors have a better stability and resolution at lower flows.

Pressure Sensors can handle restriction or contaminated gas in the flow, they have a better resistance to contamination, they are better in lower power applications, they have access to auto-zero calibration and they have a faster frequency response.
